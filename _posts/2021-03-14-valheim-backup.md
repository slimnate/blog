# Valheim Backup
One of the hosstest games on Steam since it's release [Valheim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/) has been an amazingly fun game to play. I noticed a lot of people on discord and forums talking about having lost data due to some bugs, and decided to do somethign about it.

I decided to develop a WPF application that can automatically backup world files by connecting to an FTP server and periodically downloading the files to the local disk.

For more info see the [README on github](https://github.com/slimnate/ValheimBackup).
