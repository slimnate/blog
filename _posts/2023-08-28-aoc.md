# Introduction
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar of coding problems that can each be solved in under a day. I am working through these problems now and will update this article with explanations of my solutions and reflections of them, including interesting techniques used and potential improvements.

# Challenge Runner and Helper functions

Over the course of working on these challenges, I developed a few quality of life enhancements to help myself be more productive. These include a challenge runner that allows you to run the code for any challenge using a single command, and a library of helper functions that help with more easily reading in the challenge input data.

## Challenge Runner
The challenge runner gives you a list of days to choose from, and runs the code for that days challenge upon selection. Simply run the following npm script:

```
npm run aoc
```

![Challenge Runner](/assets/img/aoc/aoc-cmd.png)

It automatically checks for sub-folders in the source directory, and uses dynamic imports to import the module for that day and run it. Each days module simply has to export a `run` function that the runner can call. It uses the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package to provide a prompt for which day to run.

# Day 1
[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) asks us to calculate information about the calorie count of food items carried by a number of elves. Each elf is carrying some number of items, each with a different calorie count. The data is provided as a list of calorie counts, with blank lines indicating that the next set of numbers are for a new elf:

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

<blockquote>
This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:<br/>
- The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.<br/>
- The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.<br/>
- The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.<br/>
- The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.<br/>
- The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.<br/></br/>
In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).
</blockquote>

## Part 1
Part 1 asks us to find the elf with the most calories, and find the total number of calories carried by that elf.

## Part 2
Part 2 asks us to find the top three elves carrying the most calories, and to provide the total calorie count of these three elves combined.

## Solution
The first step is to read in the data, and loop through each line, adding up the calorie counts along the way. I use an array called `elfCalorieCounts` to store the calorie count for each elf, and `currentElfIndex` to track which elf we are on. If a line is blank, we increment the `currentElfIndex`. If the line contains a number, we parse it to an integer, and add it to the value of `elfCalorieCounts[currentElfIndex]`

To get the answer for part one, I use `Math.max(...elfCalorieCounts);`. This uses the Array spread operator to pass each value in the `elfCalorieCounts` array as an individual argument. This gives us the answer to the first question.

To get the answer for part 2, I sort the `elfCalorieCounts` array in descending order using using Array.sort. Then I use the Array.slice method to get just the first three values from the sorted array. Then finally, I use the Array.reduce method to sum these three values.

## Reflection
There are a few interesting techniques used in this solution:

- [Spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) - used to expand the array into it's component elements, since Math.max only accepts one or more numerical arguments, not an array.
- [Math.max](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max) - Used to determine the max value in a list of numbers.
- [Array.sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) - Used to sort the array in descending order
- [Array.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) - Used to extract the first three values from the sorted array
- [Array.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) - Used to add up the individual values and return a single number

# Day 2
[Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) is about a rock paper scissors strategy guide. We are given input containing pairs of letters, one letter corresponding to the opponents move, and one letter corresponding to our move. The input looks like this:

```
A Y
B X
C Z
```

<blockquote>
Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. "The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.<br/>
The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.
</blockquote>

Each round is assigned a score, based on your choice and the outcome of the round:

>The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).

## Part 1
Part one asks us to treat the second column as an indication of what to play, determine what the outcome would be, and calculate the total score after all round have been played using the scoring guide above. 

## Part 2
Part two asks us to treat the second column as an indication of the desired result of the match, and to determine the final score after all rounds using this new strategy.

>X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win.

## Solution

For this puzzle, I took a more object oriented approach, creating a class `Choice` that represents one of the three possible choices (rock, paper, scissors), and has a method called `result` that takes a `Choice` parameter and will return the results of a match played with that choice (win, lose, draw). I used a few enum-like objects to help calculate the point values.

For part two, I added a function `getNeededChoiceForDesiredResult` that takes in the opponents `Choice` and the desired result, and then returns the `Choice` object that I should choose to get the desired outcome. I then use this choice to determine the outcome of the match and calculate the results the same way as part one. This function is pretty cleverly written in my opinion. It creates an array of each possible choice, and then uses the Array.filter method to filter out the choices that would result in the incorrect result.

## Reflection
For this solution I am pretty happy with how my code came out and some of the techniques used, but there are a few improvements I would make. I think going OOP on this challenge was a good idea and worked out well, and using the pseudo-enum types helped my code to be more readable in the end.

To make this code more robust, I would probably decouple the `Choice` constructor from the different choice strings (A, B, C, X, Y, Z) - it violates the single responsibility principle, since the choice object doesn't need to know about the encoding details of the problems input. Instead I might use another function or enum to map the input strings to a single set of choice strings (rock, paper, scissors), allowing the class to be used in other contexts as well.

I would also probably modify the `result` function to not use a switch statement, as I think in this case it makes the code less readable, and longer than it needs to be. There might be some clever array function that could do this in many less lines, but for the use case I think just using cleaner if/else statements would be fine.

For performance improvement, I would also make the `possibleChoices` array in the `getNeededChoiceForDesiredResult` method a constant outside the method rather than creating it on every invocation, since the `filter` method does not modify the original array. It could be argued that this is a case of premature optimization, but I think it would qualify more as just better design overall, as it does not take away from readability or maintainability in pursuit of performance gains.

### Interesting techniques:
- [Array.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
- [Enums (kind of)](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/enum) - Though JavaScript does not have support for enums, I used normal objects in an enum-like way. In the future I might try to use the class based approach discussed on the article linked here for more robustness.


# Day 3
[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) is all about strings, loops, and nested loops, and though it's not required, my solution utilizes recursion as well. It asks us to examine a list of strings. Each string represents a **rucksack**, and is split in half into two **compartments**.

Sample input:

```
vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
```

Each character of the input string represents a unique **item** (case-sensitive), and each item has a **priority**:

<blockquote>
To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:

- Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
- Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.
</blockquote>

## Part 1
Part one asks us to check each **rucksack** for the **item** shared between the two **compartments**, calculate it's **priority**, and then calculate the total **priority** for all such items.

## Part 2
Part two asks us to look at all the **rucksacks** in groups of three, find the item shared among all three **rucksacks** (known as the **badge**), and compute the total priority for all of the **badge** items.

## Solution
This solution utilizes more of a functional style than the previous challenge. The heart of this solution is the `getSharedItems` function, which utilizes a recursive algorithm to find all the **items** (characters) shared by any given list of **packs** (strings). This algorithm works as follows:

1. Given a list of **packs**, use Array.shift to get the first two **packs** (*pack1* and *pack2*).
2. Create an empty string **sharedItems**
3. For each **item** in *pack1*
   1. For each **item** in *pack2*
      1. If the **items** match, concatenate them to **sharedItems**
      2. If they don't, just move on
4. Using Array.unshift, add **sharedItems** to the start of the **packs** array.
5. If **packs** only has one element left, return **sharedItems**
6. Otherwise, call this method again with the new list of **packs**. This will continue until no more **packs** remain.

For part one, we just need to loop through each input line, split the **rucksack** into two evenly sized **packs** using the String.substring method, and get the shared items among each pack. Then we use the `getPriority` method to compute the **items** priority and add it to the total.

For part two we do the same thing, but instead we use a for loop where the update clause adds `3` to the index, and uses 3 **rucksacks** as input to the `getSharedItems` method instead of splitting one **rucksack** into 3 **compartments**

## Reflection
For this solution, I designed my code with much more robustness in mind. For example, the `getSharedItems` method is designed with the following properties:
- Will not fail if `packs` parameter only contains one item, instead it will jst return that item, as the shared characters among one string are simply the string itself.
- Can handle any number of input strings, instead of just the two and three that are required for the specific problem.
- Can handle cases where there are more than one character shared among the strings, even though this problem only has cases where there is a single string.

Also, I would like to talk about the `getPriority` method here which utilizes the ASCII character codes to easily convert a character into it's priority value. To do this, it uses the String.charCodeAt method to get the ascii code for the item, and then does some math on that code to convert it to the priority values provided in the problem.

### Interesting techniques:
- [Recursion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion) - A technique where a method calls itself over and over until a desired result is achieved
- [Array.shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift) and [Array.unshift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift) - The versions of [Array.pop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) and [Array.push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) that work on the beginning of the array rather than the end. Honestly this solution could have used either one and worked exactly the same, and maybe there are some performance benefits to using pop/push, but this is purely speculative on my part.
- [String.substring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring) - used to get part of a string by specifying a start and end index
- [String.charCodeAt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt) / ASCII codes
