**Nathan Hoyt (aka Slim Nate)** - 26, programmer, musician, builder, fixer, maker.

The goal of this blog is to catalog all of my different learning and creative adventures in one place, to serve as a knowledge catalog for my future self and a source of information and inspiration for all those interested in my exploits. Topics discussed will include software libraries, data science, AI/Machine Learning, software/hardware cracking, digital electronics, music, engineering and building things, and even automotive/home repair.

Basically, any topic that I think will be interesting or useful to at least a few people, I will try to create a post about. All pages, including this one, are written with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, and the site's source code is freely available [here](https://github.come/slimnate/blog). I'll probably try to write a post about settings up this website at some point.

I was originally inspired to create this blog while working through the **fast.ai** [*Practical Deep Learning for Coders*](https://course.fast.ai/) course, which is available online for free.
