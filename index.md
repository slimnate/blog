Hello, and welcome to the Slim Nate blog!

The goal of this blog is to catalog all of my different learning adventures in one place, to serve as a knowledge catalog for my future self, as well as hopefully a source of information and inspiration for all those interested in my exploits. Topics discussed will include software libraries, data science, AI/Machine Learning, software/hardware cracking, digital electronics, music, engineering and building things, and even automotive/home repair.

Basically, any topic that I think will be interesting or useful to at least a few people, I will try to create a blog post about. All pages, including this one, are written with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and have their source code freely available [here](https://github.come/slimnate/blog).

I was originally inspired to create this blog while working through the **fast.ai** [*Practical Deep Learning for Coders*](https://course.fast.ai/) course, which is available online for free. As a result, many of my first blog posts will revolve around machine learning and artificial intelligence.
